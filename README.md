##Description
- The module 1 challenge consisted of taking existing code (both html and css) and adding acessability through the renaming of elements and consolidation of css selectors. 

- Alt text descriptors were added to image files for visually impaired users.
- Div elements were replaced with semantic elements
    -Header
    -Nav
    -Section
    -Aside
    -figure
    -Footer
- In CSS class selectors were consolidated due to redundencies in code. Some class selectors were consolidated into overarching terms that applied to multiple instances, some class selectors were replaced with element tags
